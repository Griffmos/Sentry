DPS (Degrees per Second) = Ks * (Kp + Kd)
Where
Ks = a constant speed (found through testing)

Kp = (currDist/origDist)*p
	Where
	currDist = current distance from center of screen (where gun is aiming) to target
	origDist = original distance (when target was first found) from center of screen (where gun is aiming) to target
	p = a constant
(intention is to ramp speed based on how close we are getting to the target)

Kd = abs(currKp-lastKp)*d
	Where
	d = a constant
(intention is to add more speed by increasing the term limiting the speed so that the speed doesn't drop too fast)
